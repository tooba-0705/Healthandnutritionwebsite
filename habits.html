            <h2>Good Habits:</h2>
            <p>A healthy sleep schedule is essential to general health and wellbeing. They include sticking to a regular sleep schedule, aiming for seven to nine hours of sleep per night for adults, establishing a peaceful sleeping space free from distractions and noise, and using relaxation techniques before to going to bed. In order to improve the quality of your sleep, you should also limit the amount of time you spend on screens before bed, stay away from coffee and large meals just before bed, and exercise frequently. Establishing a nightly ritual, like reading a book or having a warm bath, can help the body know when it's time to relax and get ready for restorative sleep, which promotes general mental and physical renewal.<br></p>
            <h2>Bad Habits:</h2>
            <p>On the other hand, poor sleeping habits can seriously interfere with the body's normal circadian rhythm and jeopardise health. Inconsistent sleep patterns, such as staying up late and sleeping in on weekends, using electronics in bed excessively, consuming caffeine or alcohol close to bedtime, and doing stimulating activities just before bed are some examples of these practices. Inadequate sleep hygiene can cause problems getting to sleep, remaining asleep, and having restorative sleep. These issues can eventually contribute to daily weariness, diminished cognitive function, and a higher chance of developing chronic health diseases including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Promoting optimal health and energy requires kicking these bad habits and developing appropriate sleep hygiene.</p>
