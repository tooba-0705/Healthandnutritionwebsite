            <h2>What is Insomnia?</h2>
            <p>A frequent sleep problem called insomnia is characterised by trouble going asleep, remaining asleep, or enjoying a restful night's sleep even when you have the chance to. It may show up as difficulty falling asleep at night, waking up frequently during the night, or getting up too early and not being able to go back to sleep. Daytime tiredness, irritation, difficulties concentrating, and poor performance in daily activities can all result from insomnia. The two main forms of insomnia are chronic insomnia, which lasts for three months or longer and may have underlying causes such as medical conditions or psychiatric disorders, and acute insomnia, which lasts for a brief period of time and is frequently brought on by stress or major life events.<br></p>
            <h2>Insomnia Triggers:</h2>
            <p>Insomnia may arise or worsen as a result of a variety of factors. Stress, anxiety, sadness, and other mental health issues are common triggers. Lifestyle choices including inconsistent sleep patterns, binge drinking, using electronics right before bed, and excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption can play a role. Sleep disturbances can also be caused by environmental variables like light, noise, and an uncomfortable sleeping environment. Insomnia can also be brought on by specific drugs, illnesses including chronic pain or respiratory issues, and hormonal changes, especially in women.<br></p>
            <H2>Cure for Insomnia:</H2>
            <p>Behavioural therapy, lifestyle adjustments, and occasionally medication are used in the treatment of insomnia. A regular sleep schedule, a cosy sleeping environment, the use of relaxation methods like deep breathing exercises or meditation, and a reduction in caffeine and alcohol consumption are a few examples of lifestyle modifications. A very successful non-drug treatment method for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-I), which assists patients in creating healthy sleep habits and altering unfavourable attitudes and behaviours related to their sleep. While short-term usage of prescription or over-the-counter sleep aids may be helpful in managing symptoms, it is typically not advised to take them for an extended period of time due to possible adverse effects and dependence risks.</p>
